I like the small size - easily fits in my pockets. I specifically decided to get S23 for that reason - one of the few phones left with a small form factor. Battery life seems to be about 3 days when not used frequently. The screen is bright and sharp. Great picture quality even in low light (which has been the hallmark for Samsung with the Galaxy phones). Although I have not taken many pictures yet. I miss not getting a charger and headphones, but unfortunately that has become the standard now. If another company wants to beat Smsung and Apple, one of the advantages could be if they include accesories. Overall excellent phone.",

I like the small size - easily fits in my pockets. I specifically decided to get S23 for that reason - one of the few phones left with a small form factor. Battery life seems to be about 3 days when not used frequently. The screen is bright and sharp. Great picture quality even in low light (which has been the hallmark for Samsung with the Galaxy phones). Although I have not taken many pictures yet. I miss not getting a charger and headphones, but unfortunately that has become the standard now. If another company wants to beat Smsung and Apple, one of the advantages could be if they include accesories. Overall excellent phone.",
